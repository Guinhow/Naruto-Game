# Naruto-Game
This is a "game" made using python and pygame.


In this game I used pygame to create a 'street fighter like' game with naruto sprites.
There are 2 players, Naruto and Jiraya, both have movements and dislocate on the screen.
The characters are loaded directly into the game, no classes used (only in the button section).
Naruto's movements were made using functions and Jirayas are directly in the game loop.

Still working on it!
